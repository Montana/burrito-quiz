# Burrito Quiz 

Something I made for fun, to see what kind of burrito my brother bought from WalMart at any given time, via a multiple choice via context clues he gives me throughout conversations we have throughout the day. I'll quiz myself, and the results are always with 99% accuracy.

If you have a brother who also frequents WalMart and buys burritos, specifically the Great Value ones, and Tina's then this program is just perfect for you! Here's how you get this bad boy running, talk to your brother throughout the day, get some clues, then run this quiz, to make it executable, run

<pre>chmod u+x answer.py main.py quiz.py</pre> 

Then you're all set, run 

<pre>python3 quiz.py</pre> 

Have fun! Make sure all the dependencies are met before running.
